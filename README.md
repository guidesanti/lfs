# LFS (Linux From Scratch)

The idea here is to build a Linux from scratch with the help of the book [Linus From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).
This is an attempt to create some script and try to automate at least part of the process of building a Linux fro mscratch.
All the steps here were based on the instructions from the book mentioned above.
